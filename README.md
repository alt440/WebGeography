# WebGeography

NOTE: most of the content of this project (images, fonts, and some code) does not originate from me. The sources of the content are given in the sources.txt files that are in each respective folder.

This project had the purpose to gain some experience using jQuery and ReactJS. It was as well to gain some experience in developing web applications.

Recently added was NodeJS to act as the server to launch the website application. A MongoDB database was added as well from mlab.

# Future Features

-Possible use of Heroku

-Log in and sign up pages

-High score board (monthly and weekly)

-Practice (queries random countries infinitely) and Play (queries each country in a random manner only once). Play saves the scores, not Practice.
