# WebGeography

NOTE: most of the content of this project (images, fonts, and some code) does not originate from me. The sources of the content are given in the sources.txt files that are in each respective folder.

This project had the purpose to gain some experience using jQuery and ReactJS. It was as well to gain some experience in developing web applications.

Recently added was NodeJS to act as the server to launch the website application. A MongoDB database was added as well from mlab.

# How to Launch

# How to Launch in Linux

Step 1: Execute the exec.sh script

To do so, do the "chmod 777 exec.sh" command in the WebGeography directory first.

Then do: "./exec.sh"

Step 2: Launch the application (for next times)

Go in your terminal, and into the WebGeography directory, and type "node server.js". 

Then go in your favorite web browser and type "localhost:1337" in your search bar and voila!
